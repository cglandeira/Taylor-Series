<h1>Analysis of Taylor Series Approximation, Precision Errors, and Function Conditioning</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project explores mathematical approximations using Taylor Series expansions, focusing on the sine and cosine functions. It evaluates the impact of truncating the series and investigates precision errors, such as finite representation of constants like Ï€. Additionally, the project analyzes the conditioning of the sine function through relative forward and backward error calculations, providing insights into how small input changes can affect output. The analysis is supported by plots and discussions on model accuracy and data error.
